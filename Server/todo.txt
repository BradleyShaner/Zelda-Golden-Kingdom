increase max_pets on server
add more NPCs into pets?
more details on tame points?
pets move faster
if pet is x tiles away, warp pet to owner?
if pet is x tiles away, warp to target? (cooldown? Skill/spell?)
Check if spells allow target warping. That could be interesting to implement.
improve pet changemap/spawnpet/spawnlocation.
Pets can say things or make noises when given a target?
