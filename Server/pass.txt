create random string and send to client
client uses string to generate md5 of their password
client sends their md5 hash to server
server stores this md5 along with the random string

more secure login! admins can't peek into their passwords.

or. easier option. just use a pre-defined md5 salt and send that password md5 to server.

slightly less secure, but doesn't really matter. better than passwords.
